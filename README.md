## Project Motivation

In this project, I used the Boston Airbnb data available on Kaggle to answer 3 questions:
1. What is the most expensive neighborhood in Boston?
2. What area has the most pet-friendly properties?
3. What variables correlate with price?

The motivation behind this project is twofold. One, to familiarize myself with the CRISP-DM process of analyzing data. And two, to learn more about the Airbnb market in Boston, a city containing a wealth of culture and history.

## Installation

The code in this project uses data from Boston Airbnb listings. In order for the code to run, you will need to download the `listings.csv` file from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston) and save it in the same directory as the `BostonAirbnbAnalysis.ipynb` file from this repository.

Libraries used in this project include NumPy and pandas for data manipulation and analysis, and matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
All libraries are directly imported in the jupyter notebook and do not require separate installation apart from the Anaconda distribution of Python.

## File Descriptions

`BostonAirbnbAnalysis.ipynb` contains the code for this project in a jupyter notebook.

## Results

Answers to the questions explored can be found in the Medium post [here](https://medium.com/@jennifer.random/c366b7bd64e6).
They are also presented in the `BostonAirbnbAnalysis.ipynb` file in comments and Markdown cells.
